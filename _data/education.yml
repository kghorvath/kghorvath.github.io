        I studied for 4 years at Virginia Tech, earning my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. I'm proud of our senior project, which was to design and prototype a portable dental chair small enough to be carried onto a commercial flight, yet stable and sturdy enough to withstand use in underdeveloped areas and accomodate a wide range of body shapes and sizes. Our design was a success and in fact, has been put into use by the outreach dentistry program at the University at Buffalo.
